The only purpose of this repository is to have [Singularity
Hub](https://www.singularity-hub.org/) robots detect a [Singularity
container](https://www.sylabs.io/) build recipe in this repository and
build it on Singularity Hub.

The code in here is ripped from
[Tantalus](https://github.com/shahcompbio/tantalus) and is written by a
bunch of different people. See Tantalus' repo if you care about
authorship.
